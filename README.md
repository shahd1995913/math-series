# 1. Create a function called fibonacci. 

# 2. The function should have one parameter n. 

# 3. The function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series. 

# 4. You may implement the function using recursion or iteration.

#  5. If you are feeling particularly frisky, do both as separate functions.
# 6. In your series.py module, add a new function lucas that returns the nth value in the lucas numbers Again, you may use recursion or iteration, or both. Again, ensure that your function has a well-formed docstring.

# 7. Both the fibonacci series and the lucas numbers are based on an identical formula. 
# 8. Add a third function called sum_series with one required parameter and two optional parameters. 
# 9. The required parameter will determine which element in the series to print. 
# 10. The two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.
